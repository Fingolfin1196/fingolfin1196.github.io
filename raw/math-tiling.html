            Here is an interesting small math problem with a basis in real life that I spent some time thinking about a
            few days ago:
            How can I divide my monitor into a grid containing a user-defined number of tiles <div class="italic">
                optimally</div>?
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Before trying to find a good optimality condition, it makes sense to formulate this problem formally:<br>
            Let $W, H \in \mathbb{N}$ be the height and width of the monitor and $T \in \mathbb{N}$ the minimum number
            of tiles that our grid needs to contain.
            A solution to the tiling problem is then a pair $\left\langle w, h \right\rangle \in \mathbb{N}^2$ for which
            $w \cdot h \geq T$ holds.
            This, however, can be simplified by noting that the minimum value of one of these variables can be
            calculated
            trivially from that of the other:
            If, for instance, the value for $h$ is fixed, the lowest value for $w$ that fulfils the aforementioned
            condition is $w &#x2254 \left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil$, since the following holds:

            $$
            w \cdot h
            = \left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil \cdot h
            \geq \frac{T}{h} \cdot h
            = T
            $$

            Since $\left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil$ is the smallest integer for which this inequality holds, it
            suffices to consider either $h$ or $w$ (just swap $h$ and $w$ above) as the variable and calculate the other
            as above.
