        <h2>Tiling <span class="NoCall">a</span> Monitor</h2>
        <div class="par first">
            Here is an interesting small math problem that I spent some time thinking about a few days ago: How can I
            partition my monitor <span class="italic">optimally</span> into a grid containing at least a given number of
            tiles?
        </div>

        <h3>Formalising the Problem</h3>
        <div class="par first">
            Let $
            \newcommand\coloneq{&coloneq;}
            \newcommand\eqcolon{&eqcolon;}
            \newcommand\BbbN{\mathbb{N}}
            \newcommand\BbbR{\mathbb{R}}

            \newcommand\aequi{\Longleftrightarrow}
            \newcommand\implr{\Longrightarrow}
            \newcommand\impll{\Longleftarrow}

            \newcommand\braces[1]{\left\{#1\right\}}
            \newcommand\angled[1]{\left\langle #1\right\rangle}
            \newcommand\ceil[1]{\left\lceil #1\right\rceil}
            \newcommand\floor[1]{\left\lfloor #1\right\rfloor}

            \newcommand\fun[2]{#1\!\left(#2\right)}
            \newcommand\bfrac[2]{#1 / #2}
            \fun{\Pi}{W, H, T}$ be an instance of this tiling problem, with $W, H \in \BbbN$ being the width and height of the monitor and $T \in \BbbN$ the minimum number of tiles that the grid needs to contain.
            A solution to this problem is then a pair $\theta \coloneq \angled{w, h} \in \BbbN^2$ for which $w \cdot h \geq T$ holds.
            The actual size of the resulting tiles is $\bfrac{W}{w} \times \bfrac{H}{h}$ when ignoring rounding,
            which I do, since a difference of less than a pixel is insignificant.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            When trying to find a good optimality condition, I tried a few approaches before really thinking about the
            question — I can only invite the reader to think about this before continuing.
            If, for instance, we choose tilings that maximise the space used by actual tiles, the trivial solution
            $\theta = \angled{1, T}$ is optimal.<br>

            After thinking for a little bit, I realised that the worst thing about small windows (if the small size
            cannot be helped) is that all the UI elements around the main work area (e.g. window borders, toolbars,
            scroll bars etc.) take up quite a bit of space, which means that any tiling with very wide or very tall
            tiles is unusable for large $T$.
            Thus, the property that it makes the most sense to maximise is the smaller of the two tile dimensions so
            that the usable window space is distributed in a usable manner.
            This means maximising $\fun{\mu}{w, h} \coloneq \min\!\braces{\bfrac{W}{w}, \bfrac{H}{h}}$, where the ideal tiling would be one
            with square tiles, which actually makes a lot of sense for non-creative tasks where there is no intrinsic
            aspect ratio.
        </div>

        <h3>Simplifying the Problem</h3>
        <div class="par first">
            The previous formulation makes it clear that the problem exhibits an inherent symmetry:
            If $\angled{\alpha, \beta} \in \BbbN^2$ is an optimal solution to $\fun{\Pi}{A, B, T}$ for $A, B \in \BbbN$, $\angled{\beta, \alpha}$ trivially is an optimal solution to $\fun{\Pi}{B, A, T}$.
            It thus suffices to consider the simplified problem $\fun{\Sigma}{A, B, T}$ in which we additionally require that $A \geq B$; analogously to $\Pi$, a solution $\angled{\alpha, \beta} \in \BbbN^2$ has to fulfil $\alpha \cdot \beta \geq T$, its optimum being determined by the maximum of $\fun{\nu}{\alpha, \beta} \coloneq \min\!\left\{\bfrac{A}{\alpha}, \bfrac{B}{\beta}\right\}$.<br>

            An instance $\fun{\Pi}{W, H, T}$ can then easily be mapped to $\fun{\Sigma}{W, H, T}$ if $W \geq H$ (i.e. the monitor is used in its horizontal orientation), and its solution $\angled{\alpha, \beta}$ is also the optimal solution of $\fun{\Pi}{W, H, T}$.
            If $H \geq W$ (i.e. the monitor is vertically oriented), the problem can be mapped to $\fun{\Sigma}{H, W, T}$, after which the element of the latter's solution $\angled{\alpha, \beta}$ have to be flipped, i.e. $\angled{\beta, \alpha}$ is the optimal solution of $\fun{\Pi}{W, H, T}$.
        </div>
        <div class="par">
            The restriction $A \geq B$ entails that there is always an optimal solution $\angled{\alpha, \beta}$ in which $\alpha \geq \beta$; assuming the opposite, i.e. $\alpha &lt; \beta$, we can show that $\fun{\nu}{\alpha, \beta} \leq \fun{\nu}{\beta, \alpha}$:

            $$
            \begin{align}
            A \geq {} & B
            \aequi \frac{A}{\alpha} \geq \frac{B}{\alpha} > \frac{B}{\beta}
            \implr \frac{B}{\beta} = \min\!\braces{\frac{A}{\alpha}, \frac{B}{\beta}} = \fun{\nu}{\alpha,\beta}\\
            \frac{B}{\beta}
            \leq {} & \fun{\nu}{\beta, \alpha}
            = \min\!\braces{\frac{A}{\beta}, \frac{B}{\alpha}}
            \aequi \frac{B}{\beta}
            \leq \frac{A}{\beta} \text{ and } \frac{B}{\beta} \leq \frac{B}{\alpha}\\
            \frac{B}{\beta}
            \leq {} & \frac{A}{\beta}
            \aequi B \leq A \text{, }
            \frac{B}{\beta} \leq \frac{B}{\alpha}
            \aequi \alpha \leq \beta \text{ per assumption}
            \end{align}
            $$

            Since the condition $\alpha \cdot \beta \geq T$ also entails that both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ do not need to be larger than $T$ (since both are at least $1$), every optimal solution $\angled{\alpha, \beta}$ satisfies $\beta \leq \alpha \leq T$.
        </div>
        <div class="par">
            Additionally, the minimum value of $\alpha$ can be calculated trivially from that of $\beta$ through $\alpha \coloneq \left\lceil \bfrac{T}{\beta} \right\rceil$ (this also works the other way around, but this way will prove more useful later on), since the following holds:

            $$
            \alpha \cdot \beta
            = \ceil{\frac{T}{\beta}} \cdot \beta
            \geq \frac{T\beta}{\beta}
            = T
            $$

            Since $\left\lceil \bfrac{T}{\beta} \right\rceil$ is the smallest integer for the utilised inequality holds, it suffices to consider $\beta$ as the variable and calculate $\alpha$ as above.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Having considered these things, the problem can be formulated as follows, where $\alpha \coloneq \ceil{\bfrac{T}{h}}$ is used as shorthand:
            <div class="par center">
                Find a $\beta \in \braces{1, \dots, T}$ such that $\min\!\braces{\bfrac{A}{\alpha}, \bfrac{B}{\beta}}$ is maximised.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Solving the Problem</h3>
        <div class="par first">
            Having formulated this problem formally and in a compact manner, it remains to solve it.
            A very simple approach is to iterate over the $T$ possible values of $\beta$ and choose that with the lowest value $\nu$, which would not be much work for a modern computer, even for a $T$ in the hundreds.
            If there is a simple, constant-time algorithm for solving this problem, however, it is unnecessary work, and I would not want to waste processor time because of laziness.
            To actually calculate the solution, we first need to consider that $\bfrac{B}{\beta}$ is monotonically decreasing and $\bfrac{A}{\alpha}$ monotonically increasing.
            If $\beta$ is relaxed to a real number $\beta_{\BbbR}$ (and we set $\alpha_{\BbbR} \coloneq \ceil{\bfrac{T}{\beta_{\BbbR}}}$), an optimal solution thus lies at the intersection of the function graphs, i.e. at the solution of the equation $\bfrac{B}{\beta_{\BbbR}} = \bfrac{A}{\alpha_{\BbbR}}$.
            Because of the aforementioned properties, the best integer solution can be found either by rounding
            downwards (which is the last $\beta$ with $\bfrac{A}{\alpha} = \fun{\nu}{\alpha, \beta}$) or upwards (which is the first $\beta$ with $\bfrac{B}{\beta} = \fun{\nu}{\alpha, \beta}$), which is why I will consider the relaxed formulation in the following paragraph.
        </div>
        <div class="par">
            The equation $\bfrac{B}{\beta_{\BbbR}} = \bfrac{A}{\alpha_{\BbbR}}$ might seem easy to solve at first glance, but the definition of $\alpha_{\BbbR}$ contains $\beta_{\BbbR}$ within the ceiling function, which makes solving the equation for $\beta_{\BbbR}$ harder.
            However, since for all $\lambda \in \BbbR_+$ the inequalities $\lambda \leq \ceil{\lambda} &lt; \lambda + 1$ hold <span class="italic">per definitionem</span>, the following two inequalities can be formulated, where the second is the solution of a quadratic equation where only the larger one of the solutions makes sense:
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \frac{B}{\beta_{\BbbR}}
            = \frac{A}{\alpha_{\BbbR}}
            = \frac{A}{\ceil{\frac{T}{\beta_{\BbbR}}}}
            \leq{} & \frac{A\beta_{\BbbR}}{T}
            \implr \beta_{\BbbR}
            \geq \sqrt{\frac{B T}{A}}
            \eqcolon \beta_{\BbbR}^- \\

            >{} & \frac{A}{\frac{T}{\beta_{\BbbR}} + 1}
            = \frac{A \beta_{\BbbR}}{T + \beta_{\BbbR}}
            \implr A \beta_{\BbbR}^2 - B\beta_{\BbbR}
            &lt; B T
            \implr \beta_{\BbbR}
            &lt; \frac{B}{2 A} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{4 A^2} + \frac{B T}{A}}
            \eqcolon \beta_{\BbbR}^+
            \end{align}
            $$
            Thus $\beta_{\BbbR} \in \left[\beta_{\BbbR}^-,\beta_{\BbbR}^+\right)$ holds and, through rounding, $\beta \in \braces{\floor{\beta_{\BbbR}^-}, \dots, \ceil{\beta_{\BbbR}^+ - 1}}$.
            This is a much smaller set of solutions that we could already iterate over, but which can be further simplified by considering $\beta_{\BbbR}^+ - \beta_{\BbbR}^-$, where the subadditivity of the square root — that is, $\sqrt{\lambda + \kappa} \leq \sqrt{\lambda} + \sqrt{\kappa}$ for $\lambda, \kappa \in \mathbb{R}_+$ — is used:
            $$
            \begin{align}
            & \beta_{\BbbR}^+
            = \frac{B}{2A} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{2 A^2} + \frac{BT}{A}}
            \leq \frac{B}{2A} + \sqrt{\frac{B^2}{2 A^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{BT}{A}}
            = \frac{B}{A} + \sqrt{\frac{BT}{A}} \\

            \implr{} & \beta_{\BbbR}^+ - \beta_{\BbbR}^-
            \leq \frac{B}{A} + \sqrt{\frac{BT}{A}} - \sqrt{\frac{B T}{A}}
            = \frac{B}{A}
            \end{align}
            $$
            Thus, if $\bfrac{B}{A} \leq 1 \aequi B \leq A$, which is one of the aforementioned requirements, the relation $\beta_{\BbbR}^+ - \beta_{\BbbR}^- \leq 1 \implr \beta_{\BbbR}^+ \leq \beta_{\BbbR}^- + 1$ holds, which means that we can simplify the solution set:
            $$
            \beta
            \in \braces{\floor{\beta_{\BbbR}^-}, \dots, \ceil{\beta_{\BbbR}^+ - 1}}
            \subseteq \braces{\floor{\beta_{\BbbR}^-}, \dots, \ceil{\beta_{\BbbR}^- + 1 - 1}}
            = \braces{\floor{\beta_{\BbbR}^-}, \ceil{\beta_{\BbbR}^-}}
            $$
            Thus there are only at most two candidates for the optimum value of $\beta$ that both depend on $\beta_{\BbbR}^-$, which is the easier to calculate.
        </div>

        <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
        <div class="par first">
            It is quite easy to find the optimal number of rows $h$ and columns $w$ when tiling a monitor with width $W$ and height $H$ displaying a given number of windows $T$:
            If $H > W$, check which $h \in \braces{\floor{\sigma}, \ceil{\sigma}}$ with $\sigma \coloneq \sqrt{\bfrac{H T}{W}}$ has the larger value $\fun{\mu}{w,h} = \min\!\braces{\bfrac{W}{w}, \bfrac{H}{h}}$ with $w = \ceil{\bfrac{T}{h}}$.<br>

            Otherwise, check which $w \in \braces{\floor{\sigma},\ceil{\sigma}}$ with $\sigma \coloneq \sqrt{\bfrac{W T}{H}}$ has the larger value $\fun{\mu}{w,h}$ with $h = \ceil{\bfrac{T}{w}}$.
            The complexity of these operations is constant and the calculations are, apart from the square root,
            all very basic, which makes this calculation very simple.
        </div>
        <div class="par">
            On the whole, I hope you have found this as interesting as I have — a small math problem with a nice
            solution and some real-life applications that can be simplified to the point that it can be solved very easily.
