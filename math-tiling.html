            Here is an interesting small math problem with a basis in real life that I spent some time thinking about a
            few days ago:
            How can I divide my monitor into a grid containing a user-defined number of tiles <div class="italic">
                optimally</div>?
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Before trying to find a good optimality condition, it makes sense to formulate this problem formally:<br>
            Let $W, H \in \mathbb{N}$ be the height and width of the monitor and $T \in \mathbb{N}$ the minimum number
            of tiles that our grid needs to contain.
            A solution to the tiling problem is then a pair $\tau &#x2254 \left\langle w, h \right\rangle \in
            \mathbb{N}^2$ for which
            $w \cdot h \geq T$ holds.
            This, however, can be simplified by noting that the minimum value of one of these variables can be
            calculated
            trivially from that of the other:
            If, for instance, the value for $h$ is fixed, the lowest value for $w$ that fulfils the aforementioned
            condition is $w &#x2254 \left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil$, since the following holds:

            $$
            w \cdot h
            = \left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil \cdot h
            \geq \frac{T}{h} \cdot h
            = T
            $$

            Since $\left\lceil \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil$ is the smallest integer for which this inequality holds, it
            suffices to consider either $h$ or $w$ (just swap $h$ and $w$ above) as the variable and calculate the other
            as above.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Now that the problem is formulated depending only on a single variable, we can consider the optimality
            condition.
            Here, I have tried various approaches before really thinking about the question, so I can only invite the
            reader to think about the problem, too.
            If, for instance, we want to choose a tiling that maximises the space used by actual tiles, the trivial
            solution $\tau = \left\langle 1, T \right\rangle$ is already optimal (if you ignore rounding when
            calculating the tile sizes, which I do, since the error is insignificant in this case).<br>

            After thinking about it for a little bit, I realised that the worst thing about small windows (if the size
            has to be low) is that the window borders, the toolbar, the scroll bar etc. take up quite a bit of space;
            thus, any tiling in which the tiles are very wide or very tall will be unusable for large $T$.
            As such, the thing that makes most sense is to maximise the smaller of the two dimensions and thus to
            prevent the problems I have described.
            Formally, this means maximising $\min \left\{\frac{H}{h}, \frac{W}{w}\right\}$, where the ideal would be a
            tiling with square tiles, which actually makes a lot of sense, at least for non-creative tasks where the art
            has an intrinsic aspect ratio.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Having considered these things, the problem can be formulated as follows, where $w &#x2254 \left\lceil
            \frac{T}{h} \right\rceil$ is used as a shorthand:
            <div class="par center">
                Find an $h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\min \left\{\frac{H}{h}, \frac{W}{w}\right\}$ is maximised.
            </div>
            Here, $h$ and $w$ can be swapped at every occurrence again without changing the actual solution
            $\left\langle w, h \right\rangle$.
        </div>

        <div class="par">
            Having formulated this problem formally and in a compact manner, it reamins to solve it.
            A very simple approach is to iterate over the values of $h$, which can be constrained to the finite set
            $\left\{ 1, \dots, T \right\}$ with $T$ elements and choose the best $h$, which would not be much work for a
            modern computer, even for a $T$ in the hundreds.
            If there is a simple, constant-time algorithm for solving this problem, however, it is unnecessary work, and
            wasting processor time because of laziness is something I cannot get behind.
            To actually calculate the solution, we first need to consider that $\frac{H}{h}$ is monotonically decreasing
            and $\frac{W}{w}$ monotonically increasing.
            If $h$ is relaxed to a real number $h_R$ (and setting $w_R &#x2254 \left\lceil
            \frac{T}{h_R} \right\rceil$), an optimal solution thus lies at
            the intersection of the function graphs, i.e. at the solution of the equation $\frac{H}{h_R} =
            \frac{W}{w_R}$.
            Because of the aforementioned properties, the best integer solution can be found either by rounding
            downwards (which is the maximum of $\frac{H}{h}$) or upwards (which is the maximum of $\frac{W}{w}$), which
            is why I will consider the real case in the following paragraph.
        </div>
        <div class="par">
            The equation $\frac{H}{h_R} = \frac{W}{w_R}$ seems easy to solve at first glance, the definition of $w_R$
            contains $h_R$ within the ceiling function, which makes solving the equation for $h$ harder.
            However, since for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_+$ the inequalities $\lambda \leq \left\lceil
            \lambda \right\rceil &lt; \lambda + 1$ hold <div class="italic">per definitionem</div>, the following to
            inequalities can be formulated, where the second is the solution of a quadratic equation where only the larger of the solution makes sense:
            $$
            \frac{H}{h_R}
            = \frac{W}{w_R}
            = \frac{W}{\left\lceil \frac{T}{h_R} \right\rceil}
            \leq \frac{W\cdot h_R}{T}
            \Longleftrightarrow h_R
            \geq \sqrt{\frac{H \cdot T}{W}}\\

            \frac{H}{h_R}
            = \frac{W}{w_R}
            = \frac{W}{\left\lceil \frac{T}{h_R} \right\rceil}
            > \frac{W}{\frac{T}{h_R} + 1}
            = \frac{W \cdot h_R}{T + h_R}
            \Longleftrightarrow \left( W \cdot h_R - H \right) h_R
            &lt; H \cdot T
            \Longleftrightarrow h
            &lt; \frac{H}{2W} + \sqrt{\frac{H^2}{2 W^2} + \frac{HT}{W}}
            $$
